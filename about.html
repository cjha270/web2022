    <h3>About Charles</h3>
    
    <p> Hello! My dream of becoming a baker wasn't always a top priority. Early on, I always wanted to
      serve as a soldier in the US Army. I enlisted into the Army at the age of 20 and became a 
      Combat Engineer. I served 21 years in the Army with two combat deployments to Iraq, one to Afghanistan,
      a tour in Germany for 2 years and a 15 month tour to South Korea. I have a beautiful family and two 
      gorgeous dogs.</p>
    
    <p> I first started baking when I was younger. My passion for creating goodness for people to share is my
       drive. Baking with Charles Bakery is a family centric organization that supports the local community.
